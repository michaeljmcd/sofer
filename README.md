# Sofer #

Sofer is an etext transcription app for mobile devices (particularly Android). 
The objective is to make it convenient to work on transcriptions of etexts,
particularly those in the public domain, for convenient reading in electronic
format.

In particular, this will work by making it easy to import a scanned document
(in PDF form) and compare it against an in-progress etext in lightweight
text markup language.
